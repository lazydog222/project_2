        <h2>Web Page Redesign</p>
    </div> 
    <div id = "Original Web Page" class = "container border-bottom">
        <h4 class = "pt-3">Original Web Page</h4> 
        <a href = "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/145"><img src = "./images/Web Page.png" class = "mb-3 shadow border-dark rounded w-50"></a>
        <p class = "lead"> I chose <a href = "https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/145">this</a> web page, Project Gutenberg’s link to George Eliot’s Middlemarch, for two reasons.  
            First, I am currently reading the book and visit this page a lot to access the HTML text.  Second, I 
            believe Project Gutenberg’s mission of breaking down barriers for reading great works of literature is 
            important.  The whole website is run by volunteers, who type up and translate texts.  The founder, 
            Michael Hart, explains that the volunteer model has a “lack of a need for perfectionism” and has always 
            been a “work in progress.”  He believes that there are many “different right ways” to do something, and 
            I find this to be true.  In my redesign of the webpage I want to hold onto this spirit of flexibility 
            and anti-perfectionism.  There is no final perfected interface for Project Gutenberg - it will always 
            be a work in progress that is never set in stone.   </p>
    </div>
    <div id = "Usability and Accessibility Problems" class = "container border-bottom">
        <h4 class = "pt-3">Usability and Accessibility Problems</h4> 
        <p class = "lead"> The web page has a lot of positive attributes - it is minimally designed without 
            unnecessary information and contains different options for users with varying file needs.  
            I hope to improve upon the learnability of the web page.  The different E-Book file types are 
            listed in a table with underlined links; this does not make it clear to the user that clicking 
            on the link starts a download.  Furthermore, the user is not aware when the download is finished; 
            the file is simply saved to the computer and has no direct feedback on the page.  Beyond this, I 
            hope to remove the table organization system, as it displays the information inefficiently with 
            several repeated icons.  Using a drop down menu will be more concise and will better resemble 
            the real world feeling of browsing a library shelf. <br><br> Taking this all into account, I hope to complete the following items:
            <br> <b>1. Replace the download links in the table with a dropdown menu and a download button.
            <br> 2. Use a more concise and aesthetically pleasing visual form other than the table.
            <br> 3. Replace links to related books with carousels of book covers. </b>
            <br>
            <br>Using the website accessibility checker I found two more problems that I wish to resolve:<br>
            <b>1. The “Go” button on the search bar has too low contrast.
            <br>2. Some of the table headers have no icons or text.</b><br>
